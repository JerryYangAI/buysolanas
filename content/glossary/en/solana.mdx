## Solana

**Solana** is a high-performance, open-source blockchain platform launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko. It is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto transactions at scale.

### In Simple Terms

If Bitcoin is like digital gold (a store of value) and Ethereum is like a world computer (runs programs but slowly), then Solana is like a **supercomputer** — it runs programs incredibly fast and cheaply.

### Key Features

- **Proof of History (PoH)**: A unique timekeeping mechanism that helps validators agree on the order of transactions without constant communication.
- **High Throughput**: Capable of processing 65,000+ transactions per second (TPS) theoretically.
- **Low Fees**: Average transaction cost is under $0.01.
- **Smart Contracts**: Supports programs written in Rust and C.

### Real-World Example

When you swap tokens on a Solana-based exchange like Jupiter, the trade settles in about 400 milliseconds and costs a fraction of a cent. On Ethereum, the same trade might take 15 seconds and cost several dollars in gas fees.

### The SOL Token

SOL is the native cryptocurrency of the Solana network. It is used to:

1. Pay transaction fees
2. Stake for network security
3. Participate in governance
